Libraries Used : 

Pandas : 
(import pandas as pd)
Role: Data manipulation and analysis, including loading data, data inspection, and preprocessing.

Matplotlib :
(import matplotlib.pyplot as plt)
Role: Creating static visualizations such as distribution plots and count plots.

Seaborn :
(import seaborn as sns)
Role: Statistical data visualization, providing enhanced visualizations like count plots and heatmaps.

Scikit-learn :
(from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split, from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier, from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, confusion_matrix, classification_report)
Role:train_test_split: Splitting data into training and testing sets for model evaluation.
    RandomForestClassifier: Training a machine learning model for predicting customer purchases.
    accuracy_score, confusion_matrix, classification_report: Evaluating and reporting model performance metrics.

These libraries collectively enable data handling, visualization, and machine learning model training and evaluation in the project.
