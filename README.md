# Customer Purchase Prediction

## Introduction
This repository contains a machine learning project that aims to predict whether a customer will make a purchase based on demographic and review data. We use a dataset containing customer information and their purchase status to build a predictive model using a Random Forest Classifier.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains the following columns:
- **Customer ID**: Unique identifier for each customer
- **Gender**: Gender of the customer (Female, Male)
- **Age**: Age of the customer
- **Education**: Education level of the customer (School, UG, PG)
- **Review**: Customer's review (Poor, Average, Good)
- **Purchased**: Purchase status (0: No, 1: Yes)

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Loading**: Load the dataset from a remote source.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Inspect the dataset, understand its structure, and perform initial analysis.
3. **Data Preprocessing**: Prepare the data for modeling by encoding categorical variables and splitting the dataset.
4. **Model Training**: Train a Random Forest Classifier using the training data.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
6. **Prediction**: Make predictions on new data using the trained model.
